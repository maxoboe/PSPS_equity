 Replication code for Equity and Adaptation to Wildfire Risk

If viewers are interested in replicating the data generation, some of the missing files are too large for me to upload to GitHub, or there are permissions issues associated with sharing them. 

I have uploaded versions of the final dataset to https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/AAFQRQ; this includes several components including shape files and maps, This dataset deliberately excludes any shape files drawn from SDGE's service area. Per the data use agreement to view their maps, I do not disclose those maps or any shape files that could be used to reconstruct them. Interested parties should visit this link to apply: https://www.sdge.com/interconnection-map-registration-form 


GridMET individual files are very large, so I also do not store those files. Find them here: https://www.northwestknowledge.net/metdata/data/
